            This site is a my pet project. I use it to try random things as a web dev, for the list of fun links I've bookmarked (they're on the home page),
            and also for my blog.
            The links include cool blogs I enjoy reading, useful deposits of information on various topics, and fun
            stories and ideas that I enjoyed finding out about!

            I graduated with a degree in computer engineering from McMaster Engineering, in Hamilton ON.
            I worked for Amazon in Seattle for a year, quit, and moved to Waterloo where I work on <a href="https://www.hodlbot.io/">HodlBot</a>.

            I enjoy coding, drumming, climbing, volleyball, rocket league, smash bros melee, learning, and lounging around :)
