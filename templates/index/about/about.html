        <p>
            This site is a my pet project. I use it to try random things as a web dev, for the list of fun links I've bookmarked (they're on the home page),
            and also for my blog.
            The links include cool blogs I enjoy reading, useful deposits of information on various topics, and fun
            stories and ideas that I enjoyed learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated with a degree in computer engineering from McMaster Engineering, in Hamilton ON.
            I worked for Amazon in Seattle for a year, quit, and moved to Waterloo where I work on <a href="https://www.hodlbot.io/">HodlBot</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy coding, drumming, climbing, volleyball, rocket league, smash bros melee, learning, and lounging around :)
        </p>

        <p>Some details about this site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All source code is on my <a href="https://github.com/LucasSimpson">Github</span></a>,
                specifically <a href="https://github.com/LucasSimpson/personal_site">here</a>.</li>
            <li>All the of the CSS is custom! I did this as a personal exercise in CSS knowledge.</li>
            <li>I make good use of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> for all the CSS.</li>
            <li>The backend REST API is powered by <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, with the help of the <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a>.</li>
            <li>The backend uses <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html">DynamoDB</a> as a data source. There is no SQL database attached (I'm cheap; those things are relatively expensive to host. Go AWS free tier!).</li>
            <li>This whole site is hosted serverlessly on <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">AWS Lambda</a>, and I use <a href="https://www.zappa.io/">Zappa</a> for easy deploying.</li>
            <li>Frontend used to use Angular. I removed it because I really don't need it for this, and it was slowing
                the whole site down. I used it initially because I wanted to learn Angular, and this was a good way to
                learn it! The legacy frontend repo is <a href="https://github.com/LucasSimpson/personal_site_frontend">here</a>,
                which I'm keeping around as a reference for myself. Since removing it, this page comes in at under 80KB. (not including the calvin and hobbes pic but that's hopefully cached for you).</li>
        </ul>
